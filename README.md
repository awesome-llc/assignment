# Assignment

## Intro
Awesome LLC is a fictional company that depends heavily on the ad revenue generated by its `awesome calculator` application.

The code was created long ago by its founder. This was a one-off and everything was manual.

Due to the increase of revenue around the `awesome calculator` and the interest it generated around its users and news outlets, the management team decided to expand the offering and start the development of a Power calculator.

For the development of the Power calculator and other new features, the company is scaling up and hiring more engineers. Currently, the only engineer is the founder.

Awesome LLC founder values simplicity, readability, maintainability, testability in the code.

## The Task

You may choose any framework you want, but for CI/CD the company has decided to use `GitHub Actions`.
